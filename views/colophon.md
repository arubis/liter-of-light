# Colophon #

GamLight.org was lovingly crafted using only the finest ingredients.  

### Software ###

Copy is created in John Gruber's [Markdown][]. Layout and formatting uses the fantastic [Bootstrap][] framework. Content and formatting are married through [Haml][] and [Sass][], with [Compass][] negotiating between Boostrap's LESS backend and Sass's overwhelming extensibility. [Sinatra][] ties all the wires together and looks good while doing it. Code and copy alike pass through [Sublime Text][], with some copy originating in [WriteRoom][]. Photographs are managed using [Aperture][] with occasional touch-ups in [Pixelmator].

### Services ###

GamLight is hosted courtesy of [Heroku][]. All the original code is available to fork on [GitHub][]. Type is set using [Typekit][], mostly into the lovely Dagny Web Pro. 

### Hardware ###

All original content here was either pounded into they keys of a first-generation Apple Intel MacBook Pro (c. 2006, an absolute never-say-die workhorse of a laptop) or passed through the lens of a Nikon D90.
