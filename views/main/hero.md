Using cheap, simple, locally available components, Solar Bottle Bulbs enable people living off the grid to see and read indoors during daylight hours, more safely and sustainably than ever before. Inspired by the [Liter of Light][] project, GamLight aims to install bottle bulbs in schools across The Gambia to help increase literacy.
