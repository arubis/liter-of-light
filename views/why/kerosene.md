Kerosene was the prior generation of off-grid lighting in West Africa, now replaced with battery-driven LED torchlights. And good riddance!

Kerosene is expensive and dangerous to store and use. It emits dirty and unhealthy smoke and fumes, and is terrible for the environment.

Kerosene lanterns don't even produce much light! And they're hot!  

They won't be missed.
