LED torchlights are current in-place tech. Cheap, high-powered LEDs extend the life of available batteries, driving their operating costs below that of kerosene.  

_However..._ The batteries used in torchlights are _terrible._  

They're a recurring expense, taxing the resources of rural African families. Used batteries are often left on the ground or, at best, buried; they contain strong acids and heavy metals and both can leach into the water supply.
