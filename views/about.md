# GamLight #

GamLight brings earth-friendly indoor light to rural Africans at a groundbreaking price, without the need for electricity and using only locally-available materials. Inspired by the Filipino [Liter of Light][] project, we assemble and install Solar Bottle Bulbs in classrooms and residences across The Gambia, and train others to do the same. Each Solar Bottle Bulb has a nominal materials cost of about US$1 and can radiate as much light as a 55W incandescent bulb during daylight hours. A single bottle bulb can provide more light than a CFL bulb and last for years without maintenance. By installing an array of ten or more bulbs in a classroom, we add enough light that students and teachers alike can read better.

## Solar Bottle Bulbs ##

A Solar Bottle Bulb is effectively a skylight that diffuses sunlight across the room. We accomplish this in buildings with corrugate metal roofs and no ceiling by fixing a 1.5L plastic bottle halfway lengthwise through a cut-to-fit hole in the roof, then filling the bottle with water. Sunlight refracts every time it strikes a surface, scattering the light in all directions. There's more to the actual construction for leakproofing and efficiency of installation, but that's just details.
