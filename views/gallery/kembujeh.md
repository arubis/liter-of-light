Kembujeh Lower Basic School, located in Kembujeh, Kombo, The Gambia, was one of the initial pilot school installations sponsored by the Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education. Over the course of a weekend, chief carpenter Pa Demba assembled and installed ten bottle bulbs each in two classrooms with perforated block-style windows, which are particularly poor sources of light. The completed installation significantly increased available light in the classrooms, enabling students to better read and earning acclaim and laudations from students and administrative staff.
