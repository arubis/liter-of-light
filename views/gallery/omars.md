Omar's Kitchen is a long-standing institution in The Gambia. Frequented by a mix of locals, relief workers, and expatriates, and centrally located at the Traffic Light junction in Fajara, Omar's is an ideal location to demonstrate the efficacy of Bottle Bulbs.  
When Omar recently had a new kitchen building constructed, GamLight installed eight Bottle Bulbs in the roof. Omar can see to cook more safely and comfortably, and anyone interested in seeing functioning Bottle Bulbs is welcome to take a lookâ€”and perhaps enjoy some of Omar's delicious local dishes.
