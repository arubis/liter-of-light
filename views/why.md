# Why Use Solar Bottle Bulbs? #

* Cost
* Safety
* Environmental Impact
* Availability

For daytime use, Solar Bottle Bulbs are a (descriptor) leap over existing solutions for off-grid and rural lighting.

Existing solutions:

* Kerosene (expense, fire hazard, environmental impact, weak light, immediate health risk)
* Electrical (expense, fire hazard, environmental impact, shock risk)
* Torchlights (expense, wasteful, environmental impact)
* D-Light / solar charged lanterns (availability, expense -- targeted at different use case (night))
