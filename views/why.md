# Right, so here's the story: #

Across West Africa, schools, homes, cookhouses, stores and workplaces alike are typically constructed from mud brick, and roofed with either grass or corrugated metal. Windows are small, because otherwise the walls will fall apart.  

_Very little light_ gets in.    

  * In classrooms, it's hard to read.
  * In cook houses, it's difficult to see whether food is properly cooked.
  * In homes, it's often impossible to see anything at all without another light source.

Solar Bottle Bulbs aren't the only way to solve these problems. But for daytime lighting... 


<!-- Revolution under way: kerosene -> battery/electrical -> greener tech (target CWllc folks? { d.light, offgrid solar, liter of light, other? }) -->

### Solar Lanterns / d.light ###

* great tech! link thereto
* safe
* reliable
* green/clean/earth-friendly (little to no post-manufacturing carbon footprint)
* reasonably affordable
* limited availability
* addresses a different use case -- they target lighting at night, LoL is daylight tech

### Solar Bottle Bulbs ###

* great tech!
* safe
* reliable
* reuses materials otherwise discarded
* incredibly green/clean/earth-friendly (no carbon footprint, pot. negative?)
* highly affordable
* local materials & construction
* daylight only
