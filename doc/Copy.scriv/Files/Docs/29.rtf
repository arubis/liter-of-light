\f0\fs28 \cf0 In October 2012, the Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education authorized and supported a pilot installation of Solar Bottle Bulbs at Kembujeh Lower Basic School in Kembujeh, Kombo, The Gambia. Over the course of a weekend, chief carpenter Pa Demba assembled and installed ten bottle bulbs each in two classrooms with perforated block-style windows, which are particularly poor sources of light. The completed installation significantly increased available light in the classrooms, enabling students to better read and earning acclaim and laudations from students and administrative staff.}
