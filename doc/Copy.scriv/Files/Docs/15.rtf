\f0\fs28 \cf0 LED torchlights are current in-place tech. They don't present the significant and immediate burn hazards kerosene does. The new availability of cheap, high-powered white LEDs extends the life of available batteries by an order of magnitude, driving their operating costs below that of kerosene. Few would contest that this is a good thing. LED torchlights will be an off-grid light source for the mid- to long-term.\

The batteries used in torchlights present mitigated versions of some of the same problems as kerosene use. Their continued consumption is a drain on the financial resources of the impoverished. Without a proper disposal mechanism, batteries are often left on the ground or, at best, buried; they contain strong acids and heavy metals and both can leach into the water supply. And while it's nowhere near as bad as kerosene, there exists the possibility of chemical burns from burst batteries.}
